First we need to create the repository in the github website ..
go to terminal 
1) git init -> it will initialize the git
2) git status -> it will just show us what files are modified or changed
3) git add . -> will add all the files which are modified
4) git add filename -> it will add only that specific file
5) git checkout . -> will discard all the changes of your local
6) git checkout specificfile -> will discard only specific file
7) git commit -m "message of the commit" -> it will commit our staged changes
